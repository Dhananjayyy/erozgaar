Right now, India is facing a major issue of unemployment, particularly in the unorganized sector.

The unorganized sector contains a significant portion of the Indian workforce, ranging from various informal and non-standardized jobs.
This sector often faces challenges related to job visibility, accessibility, and fair employment practices.

The unorganized sector, characterized by its diverse and informal nature, lacks a centralized platform for job seekers and employers.
Many individuals in this sector struggle to find suitable employment opportunities, while employers face difficulties in identifying and connecting with potential workers.	

The eरोज़गार-Connect job portal addresses these challenges by providing a digital space that facilitates efficient job matching, enhances job visibility, and promotes fair employment practices.
